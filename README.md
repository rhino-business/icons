Tiny Icons

Small icons:
"No smoking"
 &
"18+"

That kit is recommended when you publish an article about smoking items. Some websites ought to notify visitors about adult
content such as images of tobaccos, hookahs, vapes and other products, according to the local law. That's the easy way to keep
the requirements.
